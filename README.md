# Welcome to Daunte Figueroa and Warrick Tsui's Tetris Project!
This is our ECE241 final project. We applied our knowledges of FPGAs and Verilog to design this game. <br/>
It is run on the DE1-SoC board and a VGA display.

Here is a brief video of our game :)
We were able to implement the key features of dropping, movement, and rotation.
